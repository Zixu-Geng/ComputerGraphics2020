My MacBook Pro nds to go into the repair shop. I need to migrate your GitHUB to my old MacBook.


## Midterm Presentations Today

## Final Project Information

*START THE FINAL, PROPOSAL DUE MON, NOV 30th*

*DUE --> Monday December 14th, 15:30 - 18:30 -- Room IB1012*


Your final project package will include: a project proposal due one week before presentations, you’re working final application, the code from your application and the PowerPoint you use during your presentation.

For the final project and presentation, you will code an application in C++/openFrameworks that produces an interactive application that utilizes ofxAddons such as OpenCV and computer vision which speaks to your own artistic or design interests. Feel free to explore different ofxAddons, computer vision, meshes, 3D data (Kinect), video, AR/VR, shaders and rendering and combine it with generative design, physics simulation, games, abstract composition, color, images, drawing, data or math visualizations, motion graphics, or any aesthetic direction you wish. You should show off your own skills and unique interests.

You should have a concept and some rough, initial prototype code ready to share with me before the next class as a project proposal, Mon, Nov. 30th.An example proposal will be shared with you in class. The proposal should be about 750 words. Your proposals will be returned to you during class, Wed, Dec. 2nd.

Code an app in C++/openFrameworks that produces an interactive application that “sees”, and which speaks to your own artistic or design interests!
I encourage you to focus on the use of computer vision to create software that can "see" that utilizes hardware such as the Kinect to map the depth of field, gestural control, full body and multiple person interaction for your final. If you choose to use other ofxAddons such as interfacing with Arduino and sensors to explore a different creative concept for “seeing” for your application, you will propose that in your final project proposal, and we can work together to realize your creative vision. Some examples of these are interfacing with Arduino microcontrollers and ultrasonic sensors to create a visual and musical composition, utilizing networks to gather data sources for generative manipulation of 3D objects, etc. 

Similar to your midterm project, you are welcome to combine this project with other classwork or outside work - but you must use openFrameworks, and there must be at least one ofxAddon combined with interactive elements such as computer vision, meshes, 3D data (Kinect), video, AR/VR, shaders and rendering to your application. You will demonstrate your application in front of class and present your code as a logical walkthrough of it. You should organize your code using classes, objects, methods, ofxAddons, and any of the C++ programming techniques we've learned throughout the course.

Be ready to demo the app on the big screen in class on *Monday, Dec. 14th*.

You should organize your code using classes, objects, vector, and any of the C++ programming techniques we've learned so far in a PPT for the presentation.
