# ComputerGraphics2020

MEDIART 206: Computer Graphics - openFrameworks
Fall Session 2 2020  

Week 05 - Class 10

# UPDATE, COURSE CANCELED TODAY
**Please review the example code below and e-mail me any questions.**

**Homework (Due on the normal weekly schedule):**
 
Create a new (don’t use old homework code or example code from class) open Frameworks application that has the theme “Winter is coming”. This could be literal or figurative. Examples could be a game about the white walkers from Game of Thrones, a story book about the 4 seasons of the year, etc. Make sure you use interactive, animation, OOP (classes) and 3D techniques learned in class.

**Course topics for the rest of the session**



**Course 11** – Monday November 30th – More about 3D, Meshes + introducing Shaders, Rendering and Advanced Computer Vision (3D data) and start talking about Kinect.

**Course 12** – Thursday December 2nd – OfXaddons, Text Input, Image Processing + OpenCV/Kinect

**Course 13** – Monday December 7th – More Shaders, Graphics Pipeline, Kinect, Face Tracking (Maybe Arduino)

**Course 14** – Wednesday December 9th - In Class Final Project Workshop and Q/A.

**Final Presentation** – Monday December 14th – Final Presentations and Finals Due.

## \*REVIEW CODE FROM LAST COURSE

### Vector/Collision

- **`Vector Field`** - Create a Vector Field
- **`Collision Detection`** - Collision Detection

### Camera
- **`Slit Scan`** - shows how to sample from the webcam to make [slit scan][1] photos

### 3D & Scenes

- **`3d Basics`** - Draw a simple triangle from 3 points, and a sphere

### 3D Lighting

- **`Waver`** - 3D mesh grid, displaying image, with lighting and cameras
- **`LightsShapes`** - Create simple shapes and light them     

### Meshes

- **`Mesh Webcam`** - Warp a mesh based on webcam input    
- **`3d Slit Scan`** - Similar to `MeshWebcam` but uses slit-scan from webcam 
- **`Terrain`**  - Build a terrain based on a "height map" image. Apply a painted texture and accurate lighting (using normals)  
- **`Plane Mesh GUI`** - build a 3D plane (a grid mesh) modified by noise waves
   - uses ofxGui addon (+ ofParameter) to generate noise waves
- **`Volcano Particles`** - 3D particle system, volcano mesh and 3D lighting
